# hyperskill-banking-system
### My Simple Banking System project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #8

**Covered Topics from the Course:** #47

**About:** A simple banking system where the user can create a new banking account, log in to it, view balance, add income, transfer money to another existing account, close the account or log out and let another user use the banking system. All the account details (credit card number, pin code, and balance) are stored on a database using SQLite3. The program also uses Luhn algorithm to validate a credit card number either when creating a new card or when the user wants to transfer money to another account. The banking system is on all the time unless the user enters 0 to exit.

**Learning Outcomes:** Along with doing the project itself and finding solutions to numerous problems, I was learning more about Python syntax and became more confident in working with classes, methods and functions. I gained knowledge of the anatomy of a credit card, and learnt how to implement the Luhn algorithm to verify the credit card number and find the checksum (the last digit of a credit card number). Furthermore, I learnt how to utilize SQLite3 to create a database and work with it in Python programs. This project also allowed me to practice writing SQL code.
